# Multi_Database_MCP_Client
A modular MCP client project connected to multiple SQL database servers (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) with seamless database switching and query execution.

## Overview
This project implements an **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Client** that connects to multiple servers—**Filesystem, Custom Tools, MySQL, and PostgreSQL**—to execute certain tasks programmatically. The setup enables **dynamic database switching, query execution,** and **communication** through the MCP protocol. It enables seamless interaction with databases and file systems using a unified **tool-based architecture**. It is built to showcase **scalable back-end interaction** using **client-server architecture**. The setup is modular, extensible, and ideal for automation, backend logic, or intelligent agent workflows.
