# Multi_Database_MCP_Client
A modular MCP client project connected to multiple SQL database servers (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) with seamless database switching and query execution.

## Overview
This project demonstrates a working MCP (Model Context Protocol) client that connects to SQL-based servers(mySQL and PostgreSQL). The setup enables dynamic database switching, query execution, and communication through the MCP protocol. It enables seamless interaction with databases and file systems using a unified tool-based architecture. It is built to showcase scalable back-end interaction using client-server architecture. The setup is modular, extensible, and ideal for automation, backend logic, or intelligent agent workflows.
